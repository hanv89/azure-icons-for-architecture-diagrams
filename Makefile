# Output-repo Makefile — one-time setup + smoke shortcuts.
#
# After cloning the repo, run `make setup` once to:
#   - point git at the in-tree pre-push hook (.githooks/pre-push) so the
#     leak-check workflow's catches are also enforced locally before any
#     push reaches GitHub.
#   - verify the prerequisites (`node`, `npm`, `gh`) are installed.
#
# Smoke targets wrap the most common commands you'd run during a release
# cycle; each one is a thin shell call so you can copy-paste the underlying
# command into the terminal if you don't have `make`.
