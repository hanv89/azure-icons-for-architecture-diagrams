# Assert every <img:URL> icon reference taught by the skill resolves to a
# real file in dist/ AND appears in the relevant per-vendor INDEX.md.
#
# This is the executable form of the "Filename rule (non-negotiable)" in
# SKILL.md: a guessed / renamed / removed icon path returns HTTP 404 from
# raw.githubusercontent.com and PlantUML renders a silent broken-image
# placeholder. Catching it here (offline) closes the loop before the
# manual render gate.
#
# Scope notes:
#   - Only real repo-hosted URLs
#     (raw.githubusercontent.com/hanv89/azure-icons-for-architecture-diagrams/<ref>/dist/...png)
#     are validated. Documentation placeholders like `<img:URL>` are ignored.
#   - SKILL.md deliberately contains ONE broken reference inside a fenced
#     "WRONG" anti-example block (it demonstrates the 404 failure mode).
#     Fenced code blocks whose body contains the WRONG marker are stripped
#     before extraction so the anti-example does not trip the gate.
#   - URL-encoded parens (%28 / %29) in Azure monochrome filenames are
#     decoded before the existence check.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — every reference resolves + is indexed.
#   1 — at least one broken reference or missing INDEX entry.
#   2 — environment problem (no source files found).
